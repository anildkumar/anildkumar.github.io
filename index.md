**Final Project (B.Tech.) : Social Networking**

**Front End :** ASP.NET (C#.Net, ADO.Net)         **Back End:** SQL Server 2005

This project involved development of four modules that were integrated into a social networking website. The Activity module keeps track of an user&#39;s actions on the website and summarizes them using mini-feeds. This is done by aggregation of such activities in blocks, storing in a specialized table, and distribution via RSS. The module is extensible and has well-defined interfaces to facilitate easy integration with other modules. The messages themselves are context sensitive and customizable via the admin interface

Specifically, my responsibilities in database design and programming include:

- Designed database in SQL Server 2005 using T-SQL.
- Design process for integration of component modules using master pages.
- Developed procedures in C# for extraction of information from external modules.
- Successful deployment of database and overall project.

**Mini Project (B.Tech.)****:** Leave Management system

**Front End** : HTML (&amp; JSP)         **Back End**  : SQL

This project involved development of a system that tracks details of employee absences. The system records  employee leaves, generates corresponding  pay slips accounting for the leaves and other allowances.  It provides several reporting views for employee, supervisor and the HR manager.

Specific programming and design tasks involve:

- Created dynamically created forms using JSP and static web pages using HTML.
- Ensured connectivity with the database using JDBC/ODBC drivers.
- Feature development using JavaScript and JSP for tracking project assignments, automated monthly updates and generation of pay slips.
